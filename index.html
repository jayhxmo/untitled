        <p>is how everything starts. it’s the name of what all documents are before they become anything.</p>
        <p>that’s also me. just a young product designer desperately trying to make a name for myself.</p>
        <p>that’s also us. just a group of young designers and developers supporting, lifting each other to become the best of what we can be. both as a designer / developer and a person.</p>
        <p>if that’s also you, <a href="mailto:jay@jaymo.io?subject=Slack invite request for untitled">come join us</a>.</p>
